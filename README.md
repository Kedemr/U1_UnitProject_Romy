<h1> The Way of the Scale </h1>

<h2> Description: My Unit project starts off with a necklace and a pendant. Once the pendant is clicked, it zooms into a balance
 with a few glowing circles on one side. When the orange circle is hovered over, the screen turns black and a red dot flows down
 the screen, when the mouse is moved the background of the pendant becomes red and the dot freezes.</h2>
 
<h2> Inspiration: I found out from the past few projects that I enjoy usng circles, this time I used pictures instead though, to 
challenge myself, as I have not used many pictures before in my projects. I used watchout4snakes to find different words that
gave me sparks of part of an idea and after around 10 words I put this idea together. Last class when I was trying to make my
code work, I realized that what had just happeend reminded me a lot of the classic James Bond opening and I wanted to recreate
it somewhat. I did this by using the red dot coming down the screen and the red background. </h2>
